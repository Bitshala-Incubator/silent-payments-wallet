# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

linter:
  rules:
    avoid_print: true # Avoid using print statements in production code.
    prefer_const_constructors: true # Use const constructors where possible.
    prefer_final_locals: true # Use final for local variables when they are not reassigned.
    prefer_final_parameters: true # Use final for function parameters when they are not reassigned.
